**BREAKING**:
 - The default keybindings for zooming and changing pane sizes are now disabled due to a conflict with built-in ST features.

   You can re-enable them by opening the `Preferences: Origami Key Bindings` from the Command Palette and copying
   disabled keybindings to your user keybindings. Consider changing the key combination if you care about having
   built-in features.
